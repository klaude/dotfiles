# My dotfiles

This is a collection of my personal development setup files. I keep it here for
backup purposes, as a personal reference, and maybe possibly to help others who
need yet another reference for zsh, vim, and other configurations. It is the
product of dinking around with various frameworks, programs, and shells on
various operating systems over many years. 

The current version works on xfce in Linux, but at once point these used to
work in macOS and FreeBSD. While it works well for me, I make no gaurantees
that it will work for you. It's just a reference!

## What's tracked

* zsh
* vim
* git
* Hyprland ecosystem

## Stuff to maybe track

* vscode
* JetBrains IDEs
* Firefox
* xfce panels and other settings
